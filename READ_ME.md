To Run my local machine i have made changes in build.gradle and added lombok version.

Build didn't run local machine using gradle, so ran using gradlew.

/* --------- Improvement in the application if more time permits ---- */
1: Logging can be improved.
2: in-memory DB could be used as h2, in place of hashMap.
3: Security Can be added, atleast by using basic authentication with some hard-coded credentials
